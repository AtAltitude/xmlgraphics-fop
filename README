A. Compiling FOP

1. Prerequisites

a) Java 1.1.x or later

b) XT from James Clark

Some of the Java source code in FOP is generated from XML using
XSLT. XT must be used to generate this code.

XT is an xsl stylesheet processor written in java. At the moment you
can't use any other processor, because the make file makes use of some
proprietary features of Clark's xt which allow to write output in more
then one document. You can find XT at <http://www.jclark.com/xml/xt.html>
You have to use XT version 19991105 or later.

(Under windows you shouldn't use the prepackaged xt.exe but also the
generic jar file, otherwise make won't work)

XT relies on an sax parser like XP (also J. Clark), which can be
downloaded at <http://www.jclark.com/xml/xp/index.html>

c) make

Under windows it has been reported that the use of the cygnus
solutions port of the GNU utilities works. You can find it at 
<http://sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin/>
