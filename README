FOP readme

    What is FOP?
    FOP is the world's first print formatter driven by XSL formatting
    objects. It is a Java application that reads a formatting object
    tree conforming to the XSL 1.0 Recommendation (15 October 2001) and
    then turns it into a PDF document or allows you to preview it
    directly on screen.

    FOP is part of Apache's XML Graphics project. The homepage of FOP is
    http://xml.apache.org/fop.  Our resources page is at 
    http://xml.apache.org/fop/resources.html.
