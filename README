FOP readme

    What is FOP?
    FOP is the world's first print formatter driven by XSL formatting
    objects. It is a Java 1.1 application that reads a formatting object
    tree and then turns it into a PDF document. The formatting object
    tree, can be in the form of an XML document (output by an XSLT engine
    like XT or Xalan) or can be passed in memory as a DOM Document or (in
    the case of XT) SAX events.
    
    FOP is part of Apache's XML project. The homepage of FOP is 
    http:/xml.apache.org/fop 

    HTML-Documentation can be found in the subdirectory /docs. 

    Compilation of Fop is started by executing build. It requires
    Xerces-J, Xalan and bsf.jar (comes with Xalan) in your classpath.
