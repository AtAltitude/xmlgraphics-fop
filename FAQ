1. Running FOP I get the following messages or something similar: 
"WARNING: Unknown formatting object http://www.w3.org/XSL/Format/1.0^root"
and then a FATAL Error "Root element must be root, not default FO".

A.: Make sure that you have specified as the namespace for fo the
following string:
"http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Format"
It is analogous to the xslt namespace "http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"
