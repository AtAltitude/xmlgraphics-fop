  1) FAQ - Running FOP


   Q: Running FOP I get the following messages or something similar: 
      "WARNING: Unknown formatting object http://www.w3.org/XSL/Format/1.0^root"
      and then a FATAL Error "Root element must be root, not default FO".
   
      A: Make sure that you have specified as the namespace for fo the
         following string: "http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Format". It is analogous 
         to the xslt namespace "http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"
      
   



   Q: The char "&gt;" is inserted into the page number display like this 
      "formatting FOs into areas [1] [2] [3&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;]". Is this a bug?
   A: No, a feature. It simply means that on that page an area 
         overflowed (ie there was not enough room to fit the text in).
