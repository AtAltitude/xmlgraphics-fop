  <title tab-width="60">Project History</title>
  <p>
    The initial code for the Formatting Objects Processor (FOP) was contributed to the 
    Apache Software Foundation by James Tauber in 1999.
  </p>
  <p>
    The project evolved with the W3C specification and was quickly adopted by many. In July of 2003, 
    the most famous version of FOP, 0.20.5, was released. It is now used to produce documents all 
    over the globe.
  </p>
  <p>
    Even before release 0.20.5 a redesign effort commenced to address short-comings 
    that prevented important features from being implemented using the current design.
  </p>
  <p>
    In October 2004, Batik and FOP joined forces and together formed the XML Graphics project.
    This change was made to scale down the old Apache XML project, to improve
    project oversight, and to allow for better collaboration because Batik and
    FOP share many similarities.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 2005, the redesign finally took a leap forward, which resulted in the first release from
    the new codebase (FOP&#160;0.90alpha). Shortly thereafter, FOP&#160;0.91beta was released in December
    2005 and FOP&#160;0.92beta in April&#160;2006. Although 0.92beta still carries the beta tag,
    it has many advantages over the old version 0.20.5.
  </p>
  <p>
    The next version, to be released shortly, will be 0.93. This version should be the last release 
    before the long-awaited version 1.0, for which the team only has to implement a handful of 
    additional features.
