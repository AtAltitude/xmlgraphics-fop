      <p>
        Version 0.20.5 represents Apache FOP's current stable release. Even though it's over two years old
        this release will stay the first choice for those who want a stable product for use in production
        environments, at least for another few months until the code from out redesign effort has stabilized
        enough. This shouldn't keep you off trying out the <a href="../trunk/index.html">redesigned code</a>, 
        though.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please notice that, although we still provide support for 0.20.5, we won't fix any bugs or add any 
        new features to this branch of development anymore.
        Instead, please help us with <a href="../trunk/index.html">FOP Trunk</a> by trying it out and 
        sending us your feedback. Of course, we especially appreciate any contributions in the form of 
        documentation updates and code patches.
