  <title>Introduction</title>
<p>
The FO Tree is an internal representation of the input FO document.
The tree is created by building the elements and attributes from
the SAX events.
  </p>
  <p>
The FO Tree is used as an intermediatory structure which is converted
into the area tree. The complete FO tree should not be held in memory
since FOP should be able to handle FO documents of any size.
   </p>

<section>
  <title>FONode</title>
<p>
The class inheritance described above only describes the nature of the
content. Every FO in FOP also has a parent, and a Vector of children. The
parent attribute (in the Java sense), in particular, is used to enforce
constraints required by the FO hierarchy.
</p>

<p>
FONode, among other things, ensures that FO's have a parent and that they
may have children.
</p>

<section>
  <title>Making FO's</title>
<p>
An FO maker is read from a hashmap lookup using the namespace and
element name. This maker is then used to create a new class that
represents an FO element. This is then added to the FO tree as a child
of the current parent.
</p>

<p>
Properties (recall that FO's have properties, areas have traits, and XML
nodes have attributes) are also a concern of <em>FOTreeBuilder</em>. It
accomplishes this by using a <em>PropertyListBuilder</em>. There is a
separate <em>PropertyListBuilder</em> for each namespace encountered
while building the FO tree. Each Builder object contains a hash of
property names and <em>their</em> respective makers. It may also
contain element-specific property maker hashes; these are based on the
<em>local name</em> of the flow object, ie. <em>table-row</em>, not
<em>fo:table-row</em>. If an element-specific property mapping exists,
it is preferred to the generic mapping.</p>
<p>The base class for all
properties is <em>Property</em>, and all the property makers extend
<em>Property.Maker</em>. A more complete discussion of the property
architecture may be found in <jump href="properties.html">Properties</jump>.
</p>

<section>
  <title>Foreign XML</title>
<p>
FOP supports the handlingof foreign XML.
The XML is converted internally into a DOM, this is then available to
the FO tree to convert the DOM into another format which can be rendered.
In the case of SVG the DOM needs to be created with Batik, so an element
mapping is used to read all elements in the SVG namespace and pass them
into the Batik DOM.

<section>
  <title>Extensions</title>
<p>
It is possible to add extensions to FOP so that you can extend the ability of
FOP with respect to render output, document specific information or extended
layout functionality.
