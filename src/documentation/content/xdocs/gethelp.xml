      <title>How to get Help</title>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Have a look at the documentation pages on this site. You can find
          information on how to run FOP, how to embed it, how to add custom
          fonts etc.
        </li>
        <li>
          Consult the <link href="faq.html">FAQ</link> to see if your question
          has already been answered before.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you have a question concerning XSLFO that is not related to FOP
          directly or regarding XSLT, please consult the various resources on
          the net. See <link href="resources.html">Resources</link> for some
          interesting links.
        </li>
        <li>
          Before you post your questions to one of the mailing lists, please
          search the mailing list archives, since it's possible that your
          question has already been answered but it may not have found its way
          into the FAQ. You'll find links to the mailing list archive in the
          <link href="resources.html">Resources</link>.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you still can't solve your problem subscribe to FOP's user mailing
          list and post your question there. Your question is likely to be
          handled more favorably the further down the following checklist
          you get:
          <ol>
            <li>State the version of FOP you're using.</li>
            <li>Include detailed error messages, if there are any.</li>
            <li>Provide FO code instead of XSLT snippets or DocBook source.
              See <link href="running.html#running_xalan">Running Xalan</link>
              for how to produce FO from your XML+XSLT.</li>
            <li>Provide complete, <strong>self-contained</strong> FO code.
              This includes images. Be careful with confidential material
              though.</li>
            <li>Provide <strong>short</strong>, self-contained FO code. Cut
              out everything unnecessary to demonstrate the effect, in
              particular images.</li>
            <li>Prune stack traces sensibly instead of dumping the whole
              shebang.</li>
            <li>Instead of attaching large PDF files or screen shots, use a
              small B&amp;W GIF, JPG or PNG of the area of interest.</li>
          </ol>
          This makes it easier to help you.  The instructions on how to
          subscribe to the mailin lists can be found in the <link
          href="resources.html">Resources</link>.
        </li>
        <li>
          You should probably read <link
          href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html">"How to
          Ask Questions the Smart Way"</link>.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <note>
        Please don't use Bugzilla to post questions. Please ask on the user
        mailing list first if you think you've found a bug.
