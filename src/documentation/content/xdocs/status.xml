      <p>
        This is the development status of Apache FOP. A branch has been created for
        maintenance releases while the development is done to address various
        performance and design issues. Development on the maintenance branch has
        been halted as the focus was transferred entirely to the redesign effort.
      </p>

      <title>Development Status</title>
      <p>
        Development for FOP Trunk (aka Redesign) is addressing the design issues for layout and
        performance. The new design is focusing on making it possible to be conformant
        to the spec and be able to handle large documents.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first preview release will have the following: similar functionality
        to previous FOP releases (although not in every point), some new features 
        (like keeps on all implemented FOs), a rough API and a suitable design for
        developers to work on more functionality.
      </p>
      <p>
        We originally targeted for October 2005 to publish the first preview release
        but it takes a little longer than expected to prepare everything for the
        release. The first (unstable) preview release can be expected in mid-November
        2005.
      </p>
      <p>
        We now have a good overall design and have been able to add several new features
        besides recreating most of the features from 0.20.5. We are doing ongoing work
        to make it easier for newbies to jump in and help. Furthermore, an extensive
        test suite helps us maintain and improve the quality of the package.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, we also welcome any help on the layout managers. So if you 
        want to push your brain to the limit, come and join us! But don't worry:
        there are also various other locations where you can find an easier start
        into the code. And we're glad to help you get jumpstarted. Just ask!
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're looking for a road-map we have to disappoint you. This is Open
        Source and we're mostly voluteers working in their free time. What we have
        is an idea where we want to go. How fast we get there depends on the 
        available time, on how well our ideas work out while developing and on you!

      <title>Maintenance Status</title>
      <p>
        The latest maintenance release is FOP 0.20.5, released on July 18th, 2003.
        See <a href="relnotes.html">release notes</a> for more details.
        The maintenance branch has been frozen in 2004 so the team can concentrate 
        on the redesign efforts.
