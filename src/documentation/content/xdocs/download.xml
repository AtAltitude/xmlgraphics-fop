  <title>Downloading FOP</title>
    <p>You can download the latest release version from the <link
       href="http://xml.apache.org/dist/fop/">distribution directory</link>. </p>
    <p>Each version exists as binary (bin) and source (src) distribution. The binary distribution contains the
    	 compiled package along with the documentation (including some example XSL-FO files). The source distribution
    	 additionally contains the whole source code.</p>
    <p>If you want to work with the latest and nicest code, you can download it from CVS. See the section
       on AnonCVS in the <link href="http://xml.apache.org/cvs.html">xml.apache.org documentation</link> for details.</p>
    <p>Sometimes people have difficulties to access the CVS server; in this case you can download
       a snapshot from the CVS files <link href="http://xml.apache.org/from-cvs/xml-fop/">here</link>.
       Please be aware that the snapshots currently mirrors the development code for the upcoming FOP 1.0 and not the
       code from the current releases. You need to download from CVS in this case. (See the note below)</p>
    <p>If you don't download a binary distribution you have to build FOP yourself - 
    	 see <link href="compiling.html">Compiling FOP</link> for details.
    </p>
    <note>
      Important: Currently, releases of FOP are coming out of the
      "fop-0_20_2-maintain" branch. The "MAIN" branch is currently
      under development. See <link href="dev/index.html">Development Docs</link>
      for more information.
    </note>
    <p>To run FOP from the command line, see <link href="running.html">Running FOP</link>.</p>
    <p>If you are interested in embedding FOP in a Java application of your own, see
       <link href="embedding.html">Embedding FOP</link>.
