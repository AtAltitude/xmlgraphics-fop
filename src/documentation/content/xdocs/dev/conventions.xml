        <p>In order to facilitate the human reading of FOP source code, the FOP developers have agreed on a set of coding conventions.
The basis of these coding conventions is documented in the <link href="http://xml.apache.org/source.html">Apache XML Project Guidelines</link>, which requires that <strong>all Java Language source code in the repository must be written in conformance to Sun's</strong> <link href="http://java.sun.com/docs/codeconv/html/CodeConvTOC.doc.html">Code Conventions for the Java Programming Language</link>.
In addition, other conventions have been applied to the FOP project, which are summarized in the following table:</p>
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Convention</th>
            <th>Rationale</th>
            <th>Enforced By</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>No tabs in content</td>
            <td>Programmers should not have to adjust the tab settings in their editor to be able to read the source code.</td>
            <td>checkstyle</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Indentation of 4 spaces per level</th>
            <th>Maximize readability.</th>
            <th>Not enforced</th>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <p>For developers that dislike these conventions, one workaround is to develop using their own style, then use a formatting tool like <link href="http://astyle.sourceforge.net/">astyle</link> (Artistic Style) before committing.</p>
