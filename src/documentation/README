To update the FOP website:

Background
--------------
 1. The documentation is generated using forrest
    (http://xml.apache.org/forrest/).
 2. Forrest needs to be run on a machine with a graphical environment (it will
    fail in a headless environment when it tries to use FOP to generate the PDF
    files). The Apache machine available to xml-fop developers
    (icarus.apache.org) appears to be headless, so you will probably need to run
    this on a local machine with a graphical environment.

Step-by-Step Instructions
-----------------------------
 1. checkout the xml-forrest module (same repository as xml-fop).
 2. checkout the xml-site/targets/fop module (same repository as xml-fop).
 3. you will also need access to a current xml-fop sandbox (you probably already
    have one)
 4. cd to xml-forrest
 5. run: build.sh(bat) dist to build forrest
 6. set environment variable FORREST_HOME=~/xml-forrest/build/dist/shbat
    where ~ is the directory in which xml-forrest is installed
    (see http://xml.apache.org/forrest/your-project.html for details)
 7. set environment variable PATH=$PATH:$FORREST_HOME/bin
 8. cd to xml-fop directory
 9. run forrest(.bat), which will build the web-site documents in
    xml-fop/build/site.
10. NOTE: the compliance.html currently does not work, it can be fixed by
    adding the dtd ref to: build/tmp/context/resources/schema/catalog
    and placing the dtd in: build/tmp/context/resources/schema/dtd/
11. To update the actual website, copy the generated documents
    (in xml-fop/build/site) to xml-site/targets/fop. (This could also be done by
    sym-linking this destination before the build.)
12. commit xml-site/targets/fop.

Notes
---------
 1. Per Jeff Turner, the downstream process of publishing our web site is as
    follows:
    - Committers commit generated docs to xml-site/targets/{project}
    - Every X hours, a script updates /www/xml.apache.org/ or wherever on
      the live site, from CVS.
 2. Per Jeff Turner, the FOP website is being regenerated (from the contents
    of xml-site/targets/fop) by Forrest every hour.
    See http://forrestbot.cocoondev.org/site/xml-fop for the contents.
    Although we found this interesting (especially wondering how they got around
    the headless server problem), it doesn't change our workflow above, because
    we don't know where, at the filesystem level, these files exist, so we have
    no way of copying them to xml-site/targets/fop.
