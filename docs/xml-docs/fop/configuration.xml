  <s2 title="setting up hyphenation">
    <p>Fop comes already with some hyphenation pattern. If you need a hyphenation pattern
       which isn't included in the distribution, do the following: 
    </p>
    <p>1. get the TeX hyphenation pattern file and turn it into an xml file which conforms
       to the hyphenation.dtd in the sub directory /hyph
    </p>
    <p>2. name this new file following this schema: languageCode_countryCode.xml. If you don't need 
       a country code, leave it away, p.e. the file name for an American english hyphenation pattern
       would look like this: en_US.xml. For an Italian file: it.xml. Language and country codes must be
       the same as in xsl:fo, that is follow 
       <jump href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/related/iso639.txt">ISO 639</jump> 
       and <jump href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/related/iso3166.txt">ISO 3166</jump> 
       respectively. NOTE: The ISO 639/ISO 3166 convention is that language names are
       written in lower case, while country codes are written in upper case.
    </p>
    <p>3. If you have build your new hyphenation pattern file successfully there are
       two ways to make it accessible to Fop. 
    </p>
    <p>   a) Put this new file into the directory /hyph and rebuild Fop. The file will 
      be picked up and added to the fop.jar.
    </p>
    <p>   b) Put the file into a directory of your choice and specify this directory
      in the userconfig.xml in the entry <hyphenation-dir>. 
    </p>
