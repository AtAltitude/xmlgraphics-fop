  <s2 title="FOP TODO">
    <p>
Core Features - these are the areas that are important to getting fop
to be useable for general use.
    </p>
    <p>
Processing improvements - these are mainly things that can be improved
in the way fop works, eg. resources usage, pdf output etc.
    </p>
    <p>
Enhancements - these are added functionality that might be useful, no
comment is made about the suitability of these suggestions.
    </p>

  <s2 title="Core Features">
<s3 title="Layout">
    <p>
This is the crucial part to getting FOP to make it to the next step.
    </p>

<s3 title="Website">
    <p>
Need to improve the website to better demonstrate what fop is and
can do. Examples, screenshots, pdf documents.
    </p>
</s3>
<s3 title="Property Support">
    <p>
Currently all properties are in the xml file. We need to handle all default
values properly (including ones that change depending on the element) and
all possible values.
    </p>
    <p>
To see if a property is implemented then look in the src/codegen/foproperties.xml file.
    </p>
    <p>
To see if a particular element uses this property then look in the element code. This is generally found in the package org.apache.fop.fo.flow.*.
    </p>
</s3>
<s3 title="Property Resolution">
    <p>
This is support for the functions in property values that evaluate some
expression.
Better support for resolution including support for "inherit" and values
with lists.
    </p>
</s3>
<s3 title="Validity Checking">
    <p>
Check the validity of children for a particular element to ensure
there are no invalid children. Should help process the layout better.
    </p>
</s3>
</s2>
  <s2 title="Processing Improvements">
<s3 title="Image Handling">
    <p>

    <p>
A user agent (or some similar thing) is needed to handle adjustable
