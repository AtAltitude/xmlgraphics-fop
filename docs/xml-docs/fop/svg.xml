<s1 title="SVG in FOP">
  <s2 title="Introduction">
    <p>
FOP uses the SVG library from <jump href="http://xml.apache.org/batik/">Batik</jump> to handle SVG.
This format can be handled as an <code>fo:instream-foreign-object</code> or in a separate
file referenced with <code>fo:external-graphic</code>. Either way the SVG document will be
read in and converted into a DOM in Batik. This DOM will then be used by the renderer to
create the graphical image.
    </p>
    <p>
The AWT and Print renderers simply use batik to draw the SVG into a graphic.
    </p>
    <p>
In the case of the PDF renderer there is a PDFGraphics2D class that Batik uses
to render the image into. This class converts the drawing instructions into
PDF markup which is placed into the current PDF document.
    </p>

  <s2 title="Converting SVG to a PDF Document">
    <p>
It is possible to convert a standalone SVG document directly into a simple page PDF document.
This is possible through the use of Batik's transcoder mechanism.<br/>
<code>java org.apache.batik.apps.rasterizer.Main -m application/pdf document.svg</code>
<br/>
This will output the svg document as "document.pdf" containing a PDF rendering of
the SVG file.
    </p>
    <p>
It is also possible to specify the width and/or height of the PDF document on the command line with -w and -h or if you are using the transcoder api you can use the transcoding hints.
    </p>
    <p>
Currently the SVG image is drawn at the SVG document size and simply scaled in PDF to the new size. So the result may not be the best possible. For example if you have any images or effects it will draw them at the original resolution of the svg document. When this is viewed in the pdf it will have an incorrect resolution for the size of the pdf.
</p>
    <p>
The size of the pdf file will also remain the same regardless of what size the page is.
    </p>
    <p>
For more information see <jump href="http://xml.apache.org/batik/">Batik</jump> for
how transcoders work.

    <p>
These are the relevant classes, found in the package org.apache.fop.svg :
    </p>
    <p>
<ul>
<li><em>PDFGraphics2D</em>
<br/>
used for drawing onto a Graphics2D into an existing pdf document, used
internally to draw the svg.
</li>
<li><em>PDFDocumentGraphics2D</em>
<br/>
used to create a pdf document and inherits from PDFGraphics2D to do the
rest of the drawing. Used by the transcoder to create a standalone pdf
document from an svg. Can be used independantly the same as any Graphics2D.
</li>
<li><em>PDFTranscoder</em>
<br/>
used to transcode an svg document into a standalone pdf, via
PDFDocumentGraphics2D.
</li>
</ul>
