 <title>Area Tree</title>
	<para>
The code to implement the area tree will attempt to match the areas
defined in the specification. A number of optimisations may be possible
for similar areas and groups of areas.
  </para>
  <para>
Since the area tree will be used during the layout by the layout managers
it will need to store information that affects the layout. The information
such as spacing and keeps will be held in such a way that it can be
discarded once the layout is finalised.
