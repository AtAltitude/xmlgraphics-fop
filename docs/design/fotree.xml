<s1 title="Introduction">
<p>
The FO Tree is an internal representation of the input FO document.
The tree is created by building the elements and attributes from
the SAX events.
  </p>
  <p>
The FO Tree is used as an intermediatory structure which is converted
into the area tree. The complete FO tree should not be held in memory
since FOP should be able to handle FO documents of any size.
