  <body><s1 title="Tutorial series Status"> <p>Peter said : Do we have a volunteer to track
		  Keiron's tutorials and turn them into web page documentation?</p> <p><strong>The answer is yes
		  we have, but the work is on progress !</strong></p> <note>Keiron has recently extended
		  the documentation generation on the CVS trunk to make this process a bit
		  easier. Keiron tells Peter that Apache is readying a major overhaul of its web
		  site and xml-&gt;html generation, but that should not deter us from proceeding
		  with documentation.</note></s1>
