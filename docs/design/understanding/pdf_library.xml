<p>The PDF Library is an independant package of classes in FOP. These class
provide a simple way to construct documents and add the contents. The
classes are found in <code>org.apache.fop.pdf.*</code>.</p>




<s2 title="PDF Document">
<p>This is where most of the document is created and put together.</p>
<p>It sets up the header, trailer and resources. Each page is made and added to the document.
There are a number of methods that can be used to create/add certain PDF objects to the document.</p>
</s2>

<s2 title="Building PDF">
<p>The PDF Document is built by creating a page for each page in the Area Tree.</p>
<p> This page then has all the contents added.
 The page is then added to the document and available objects can be written to the output stream.</p>
<p>The contents of the page are things such as text, lines, images etc.
The PDFRenderer inserts the text directly into a pdf stream.
The text consists of markup to set fonts, set text position and add text.</p>
<p>Most of the simple pdf markup is inserted directly into a pdf stream.
Other more complex objects or commonly used objects are added through java classes.
Some pdf objects such as an image consists of two parts.</p>
<p>It has a separate object for the image data and another bit of markup to display the image in a certain position on the page.
</p><p>The java objects that represent a pdf object implement a method that returns the markup for inserting into a stream.
The method is: byte[] toPDF().</p>
