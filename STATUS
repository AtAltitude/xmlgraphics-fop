**** THINGS TO DO ****

1)
The main list of things that need to be done.

- design of line area handling.
- design of flow layout handling, breaks keeps, spacing etc.
- integrating Avalon and Fop

2)
These should be done with the aim of getting to basic conformance.

- Implement all remaining formatting objects
- improve property handling for types not currently supported (eg. 'large' font)
- implement all required properties

3)
Nail down external interfaces (the main part is fairly stable).
Setting base directory, using config, logging, extensions etc.
