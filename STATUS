Make sure Makefiles work
Get images working

[PARTIAL] Implement basic keeps

Incorporate Eric Schaeffer's further table fixes
Incorporate Eric Schaeffer's background colour implementation

Other Bugs to fix:

colour not continued onto subsequent pages if coloured block goes over page

Todo's and problems with AWT Previewer:

- currently the layout process uses PDF fonts. This gives sometimes
  trouble with java.awt.Font 
- we need some progress messages even if the process itself is fast
- GIF format is supported by the viewer, but disabled in FOP. BMP is
  not done, because there are no standard libraries.
- more comments/english comments
- print output using AWT
- i18n for the user interface (yes, now we need this stuff)
- toolbar images directory is not configurable
- first preview is painted twice (flashing screen)
- should "preview" be an option when calling FOP instead of having
  it's own main method?
