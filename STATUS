**** THINGS TO DO **** 

Support XSL Working Draft 27 March 2000 

1.One category of tasks will be to implement missing formatting objects. 
  There are 6  such objects: 

  fo:character 
  fo:leader [at the moment only partially]
  fo:table-and-caption 
  fo:table-header 
  fo:multi-case 
  fo:wrapper 

2. [Has been done]

3. [Has been done]

4.A fourth, and not insignificant, category of tasks is to decide upon and 
  implement all reasonable properties required by the specification. This 
  also means that at this point, until further review, no FO can be considered 
  to be compliant. 

  a) CHANGED 
   21.space-after.optimum (Incomplete) 
   22.space-before.optimum (Incomplete)

   25.min-height                                             50.z-index 

5.A fifth category of tasks is the ongoing effort to promote maintainability, 
write 
  more and better documentation, and to refine the build process. 
  a) Add the property files to the source code (how is the vote on this?) 
  b) add examples so that all the FOs supported are used in some example 

6. Redo or work on the classes/properties which have been fixed only in a superficial way 
   to conform to the latest working draft
    -  "white-space-treatment" doesn't work at the moment
    - leader is just a renamed display-rule and must be rewritten: 
      it is now (wd 3.2000) generating inline-areas and not block areas 
      and has a more complex function
    - inline is just a renamed inline-sequence and must be worked on: 
      it is now (wd 3.2000) generating an inline-area itself


**** Bugs ****

- SVG linearGradients don't appear the same as in other SVG Viewers
- colour not continued onto subsequent pages if coloured block goes over page 
- no SVG support in AWTCommandLine 
- keep-next doesn't work and doubles the text lines which should be moved to the next page
- lists containing list do not keep their indentation correctly over a page boundary

with AWT Previewer: 

- currently the layout process uses PDF fonts. This gives sometimes 
  trouble with java.awt.Font 
- we need some progress messages even if the process itself is fast 
- more comments/english comments 
- first preview is painted twice (flashing screen) 
- should "preview" be an option when calling FOP instead of having 
  it's own main method?
