2. done
3. done

4.A fourth, and not insignificant, category of tasks is to decide upon and 
  implement all reasonable properties required by the specification. This 
  also means that at this point, until further review, no FO can be considered 
  to be compliant. 

  a) CHANGED 
   space-after.optimum (Incomplete) 
   space-before.optimum (Incomplete) 
   white-space-treatment has to be renamed to white-space-collapse and adjusted
   keep-with-next (Changed)

  b) NEW 
    1.alignment-adjust                                       26.min-width

   25.min-height                                             50.z-index 

5.A fifth category of tasks is the ongoing effort to promote maintainability, 
write 
  more and better documentation, and to refine the build process. 
  a) Add the property files to the source code (how is the vote on this?) 
  b) add examples so that all the FOs supported are used in some example 

6. Redo or work on the classes/properties which have been fixed only in a superficial way 
   to conform to the latest working draft
    - leader is just a renamed display-rule and must be rewritten: 
      it is now (wd 3.2000) generating inline-areas and not block areas 
      and has a more complex function
    - inline is just a renamed inline-sequence and must be worked on: 
      it is now (wd 3.2000) generating an inline-area itself


**** Bugs ****

- colour not continued onto subsequent pages if coloured block goes over page 
- keep-next doesn't work and doubles the text lines which should be moved to the next page
- lists containing list do not keep their indentation correctly over a page boundary
- border width in fo:table is added to the start position of the next block or
  table (see page 6 in table.fo for a test case)

SVG 
- SVG linearGradients don't appear the same as in other SVG Viewers
