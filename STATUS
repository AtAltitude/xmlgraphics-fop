STATUS

Things worked on:

rewrite of the org.apache.fop.layout (implements xsl 2000) [James Tauber]
image support [Eric Schaeffer, Pankaj Narula]
simple-links [Arved Sandstrom]
SVG support [Keiron Liddle][Torsten Friebe]
borders and absolute positioning [Jon Smirl]

Things to do:

Get images working
[PARTIAL] Get padding working
[DONE] Incorporate Arved Sandstrom's simple-link implementation
[PARTIAL] Implement basic keeps
[PARTIAL] Incorporate Eric Schaeffer's further table fixes
Implement MessageHandler (or similar)

Other Bugs to fix:

colour not continued onto subsequent pages if coloured block goes over page
simple-link doesn't seem to work (I think I, JKT, broke it)

Todo's 

- Support XSL Working Draft 12 January 2000
- Makefile: Avoid recompilation of all files, fix some smaller problems

with AWT Previewer:

- currently the layout process uses PDF fonts. This gives sometimes
  trouble with java.awt.Font 
- we need some progress messages even if the process itself is fast
- GIF format is supported by the viewer, but disabled in FOP. BMP is
  not done, because there are no standard libraries.
- more comments/english comments
- first preview is painted twice (flashing screen)
- should "preview" be an option when calling FOP instead of having
  it's own main method?

History

0.12.1 release
to make the bug fix on XTCommandLine available to non developers

Done since 0.12.0 release:

basic support for padding-{top,left,bottom,right} on blocks.
implemented simple-link (don't think it works, though)
XTCommandLine now works again
background color works on list-block
list-blocks can now be in table-cell

Done for 0.12.0 release:

Make sure Makefiles work
Switch to using Status object as return from layout()
Incorporate Eric Schaeffer's fix to tables in static-content
Incorporate Kelly Campell's fixes to GifJpegImage
Incorporate Eric Schaeffer's background colour implementation
  (actually used different approach with background colour as trait)
